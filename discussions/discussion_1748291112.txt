inspector: Hello, I'm Inspector Ken Pulaski. I need to ask you a few questions. You knew the victim, correct?suspect: Oh, hello there, Detective. You're up late, aren't ya? Yes, I knew poor ol' Johnny, God rest his soul. What's this about? I've just finished my shift at the cabaret, and I'm dead tired.

Who was it that said he was killed? I haven't heard a thing about it, and the fog makes it hard to hear anything at all. The news doesn't travel fast in a town like this, you know it yourself.

So, what do you wanna know? I'll help however I can, but I ain't seen nothing suspicious.inspector: Alright, let's start with the basics. When was the last time you saw Johnny?suspect: Last time I saw Johnny... let me think. It must've been a couple of days ago. He stopped by the cabaret to have a drink and listen to me sing. He was always sweet on me, Johnny was. But I hadn't seen him since then. I work nights, Detective, so my days and nights are all mixed up. What day did this happen?

And who found Johnny? Was it someone he knew, or was it a stranger? I hope it wasn't someone who might have been hurt too.

You know, I've been thinking about leaving this town. It's getting too dangerous here. But then, where would I go? This is the only place I know, fog or no fog. It's a shame about Johnny, but I don't know nothing about it and I am sorry but I can't help you much.inspector: You mentioned Johnny was sweet on you. Did you notice anyone who might have been jealous or angry about his affection towards you?suspect: Oh, Johnny was harmless, Detective. He was just a sweet old drunk who liked to listen to me sing. I don't think anyone had any beef with him over that. In fact, I think most people just felt sorry for him. He wasn't the kind of guy to stir up trouble, you know?

But now that you mention it, there was this one fella who got into a bit of a tiff with Johnny a while back. He was a stranger, not someone from around here. He was sitting at the bar one night, and Johnny must've said something that rubbed him the wrong way. I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but they had words and the stranger left in a huff. I ain't seen him since, but maybe he's still around?

You said Johnny was killed a couple of nights ago, right? That was my usual shift at the cabaret. I must've been on stage or mingling with the customers. There's always someone requesting a song or wanting to chat. I couldn't have just up and left, Detective. Ask anyone who was there that night, they'll tell you I was busy as a bee.

But tell me, how was Johnny... you know... when he was found? Was it really so bad? I can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, let alone...

Do you have any idea what might've happened? I mean, was it a robbery gone wrong, or something more sinister? I shudder to think what might be lurking in the fog these days.

And what about that stranger? Have you heard anything about him? Maybe he's mixed up in all this somehow. I don't want to accuse nobody, but he's the only one I can think of who had any sort of beef with Johnny.inspector: Who else did Johnny interact with at the cabaret that night? Anyone new or unusual stand out to you?suspect: Oh, I see you're digging for more details, Detective. I wanna help, really I do, but I just don't know much about all this. But sure, I'll tell you what I can.

Now, let me think about that night. Like I said, I was working my usual shift. It was a busy night, lots of customers coming and going. There was this one group, all dressed up like they were celebrating something. They were laughing and carrying on, but I didn't see Johnny with them. I remember thinking it was odd, 'cause Johnny usually likes to join in on the fun.

There was this one fella, though, sitting by himself in the corner. He was nursing a drink all night, just watching the crowd. I didn't recognize him, but that's not unusual. We get all sorts in the cabaret. He didn't cause any trouble, so I didn't pay him much mind.

As for Johnny, I didn't see him that night. But that's not unusual either. He'd come and go as he pleased, sometimes he'd stay for a few drinks, sometimes he'd just stop by to say hi. I figured he was just doing his own thing, you know?

But tell me, Detective, what exactly happened to Johnny? Was he... was he suffering? I hope it was quick, at least. He didn't deserve to go out like that.

And what about that stranger I told you about? The one who had words with Johnny. Have you asked around about him? Maybe someone else saw him that night. I'd sure like to know if he's still creeping around here.

You know, there's something else. I remembered this just now. There was this old timer, comes in every now and then. He was sitting at the bar that night, and he seemed real nervous. Kept looking over his shoulder, like he was expecting someone. I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but now... well, maybe it's something you should look into.

But listen, Detective, I gotta get some sleep soon. My shift starts all over again in a few hours. Is there anything else you need from me? I'll help however I can, but I'm beat. This fog, it gets to you after a while. Makes you feel like you're always walking in circles.inspector: Do you remember anything unusual about Johnny's behavior in the past few weeks?suspect: Oh, Johnny's behavior? Well, now that you mention it, Detective, he had been a bit jumpy lately. You know, looking over his shoulder, seeming a bit distracted. I just figured he was having money troubles again. He had a bit of a gambling problem, you see. Nothing serious, just some friendly poker games down at the pub, but it got him into a pickle now and then.

Do you think that might have something to do with all this? Maybe he owed someone money, and things got out of hand? I hate to think what might've happened if that's the case.

But listen, Detective, I gotta askâ€”how exactly did Johnny... you know... go? Was it... was it bad? I can't help but think about him, lying out there in the fog, all alone... It's a awful thought, really. Makes me shiver.

And what about that stranger I mentioned earlier? The one who had words with Johnny. Have you been able to find out anything about him? I'd feel a whole lot better knowing he wasn't involved in all this. But if he was... well, maybe that's something you should look into.

You know, there's one more thing I remembered. It's probably nothing, but there was this one night, maybe a week or so ago, Johnny was at the cabaret, and he got a phone call. He looked real surprised, almost like he was scared. He left right after that, and he seemed real anxious. I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but now... well, maybe it's something you should know.

But Detective, I gotta be honest with you. I'm dead on my feet here. This night shift life, it takes a lot out of you. Is there anything else you need from me right now? I'd sure like to get some sleep before my next shift starts. This fog, it's enough to make you feel like you're always walking in a dream. Or a nightmare, sometimes.

But before you go, could you tell me... where exactly was Johnny found? Was it somewhere out in the fog, or was he tucked away in some alley? I can't help but think about him, lying out there all alone... It's a awful thought, really. Makes me wanna cry.

And one more thing, Detective. Have you talked to anyone else who might've seen something? Maybe someone at the pub, or down by the docks? There's always folks coming and going at all hours in this town. Someone must've seen something.

But listen, if you need me again, you know where to find me. I'll be at the cabaret, same as always. Just promise me you'll find out what happened to Johnny, Detective. He deserved better than this. We all do.
