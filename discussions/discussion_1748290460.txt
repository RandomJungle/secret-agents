inspector: Yeah, I'm Inspector Ken Pulaski. You got a minute? Need to ask you about last night.

Where were you between 8 and 10?

Seen anyone unusual around here lately?

You own a gun, right? Where is it now?

When's the last time you saw the victim?

Notice anything strange about their behavior recently?

[END] You'll be hearing from us. Don't leave town.suspect: Well, hello there, Detective. Gigi Monaco here, nice to make your acquaintance, though I must say, I wish it were under better circumstances.

Last night, you say? Between 8 and 10, I was at the cabaret, sweetheart. I go on stage at 9, and I was getting ready in my dressing room before that. Plenty of people saw me there â€“ the girls backstage, the stage manager, even the piano player. They'll all vouch for me.

Unusual folks around here? Honey, this is a cabaret in a foggy town. Unusual is our specialty. But nobody out of the ordinary, no. Just the usual mix of sailors, drunks, and dreamers.

A gun? Yes, I've got an old thing my daddy gave me. Said a lady should always be able to protect herself. But it's been gathering dust in my apartment for years. I never carry it around, especially not at the cabaret. Too many accidental bumps and grinds for that, if you know what I mean.

The victim... poor soul. I saw them a couple of nights ago. They came into the cabaret, had a few drinks, watched the show. But that's nothing new, they were a regular.

Strange behavior? None that I could see. They seemed like their usual self, just enjoying the night. But I don't exactly have time to play psychologist, you know? I'm too busy singing and dancing.

I'm sorry I couldn't be more help, Detective. I hope you find who did this. It's a dark world out there, and any light you can shine on it is a good thing.

You'll be hearing from me if you need anything else, darling. Just don't make it too early in the day, you know I keep late hours. And don't worry, I ain't going nowhere. This town is my home, for better or worse.
