inspector: Yeah, yeah, I know who you are. Listen, I ain't got all day to be playin' games. I need to ask you a few questions. You know a fella named Johnny Harrison?
****************************************************************************************************
suspect: Oh, hello there, detective. You'll have to forgive me, I've just woken up – life ain't easy when you work the night shifts at the cabaret. Johnny Harrison, you say? Yeah, I know him. He's a regular at the club. Likes his whiskey neat and his tunes smooth. Why do you ask? He in some kinda trouble?
****************************************************************************************************
inspector: Alright, let's cut to the chase. When was the last time you saw Johnny?
****************************************************************************************************
suspect: Well, detective, I see so many faces every night, it's hard to keep track, you know? But if I recall correctly, I think the last time I saw Johnny was... yeah, it was last weekend. He was at the bar, same as always. I remember because he was wearin' that silly fedora he loves so much. He had a few drinks, watched the show, and then left. Nothing out of the ordinary. Why, what's this about? Has something happened to Johnny?
****************************************************************************************************
inspector: I ask the questions here, kid. What time did he leave the bar?
****************************************************************************************************
suspect: Oh, I'm afraid I can't give you an exact time, detective. You know how it is at the cabaret – time just flies by with all the music and the acts. But if I had to guess, I'd say he left sometime around midnight. I remember because I was just about to go on for my second number. But tell me, why are you asking all these questions about Johnny? Has he done something wrong? Or has something happened to him? I hope he's alright, he's one of the nicer patrons, you see.
****************************************************************************************************
inspector: Alright, listen up. I need you to think real hard about this one. Did you notice Johnny talkin' to anyone in particular that night? Anyone he left with, or anyone who took an interest in him? And I ain't askin' because he won the lottery, kid. Something bad happened to Johnny, and it's my job to find out what. So, think. Did you see anything that stuck out to you?
****************************************************************************************************
suspect: Oh, I see, detective. I'm sorry to hear that something bad happened to Johnny. I truly am. He was always kind to me and the other girls at the cabaret. I wish I could be of more help, but to be honest, I was pretty busy that night, getting ready for my performances and whatnot. But let me think...

Now that you mention it, there was this one fella who seemed to be taking an interest in Johnny. I didn't recognize him, but then again, we get a lot of out-of-towners at the cabaret. He was sitting a few stools down from Johnny at the bar, and I remember seeing them talk a few times throughout the night. I couldn't hear what they were saying, though – the music was too loud, and I was focused on my own tasks.

As for whether Johnny left with anyone, I can't say for sure. Like I said, I was getting ready for my second number when he left, so I didn't see him walk out the door. But now that I think about it, I did notice that the man he was talking to earlier wasn't at the bar anymore, either. I just assumed he had moved on to one of the tables or maybe the dance floor.

Do you think this man might have something to do with what happened to Johnny, detective? I hope I've been able to help, at least a little bit. If there's anything else you need to know, please don't hesitate to ask. I may work in a cabaret, but I'm always willing to help the police when I can. And besides, I'd like to see whoever did this to Johnny brought to justice. He didn't deserve whatever happened to him, that's for sure.
****************************************************************************************************
inspector: Alright, kid. You're doin' fine. Now, this fella that Johnny was talkin' to, can you describe him for me? Anything you remember; face, clothes, anything peculiar about him. Take your time.
****************************************************************************************************
suspect: Oh, sure thing, detective. Let me just rack my brains a bit. Like I said, it was dark and smoky in there, as always, but I'll do my best.

He was a tall fella, I remember that much. Not the sort of guy you'd want to meet in a dark alley, if you know what I mean. He had broad shoulders, but he wasn't too bulky, more like... well, more like a boxer, maybe. He was wearin' a long, dark coat, like something out of one of those old gangster movies. I think it was black or maybe a real deep blue – it's hard to tell in the cabaret's moody lightin'.

His face, well, that's a bit harder to recall. He had one of them hats, you know, a fedora, but it was pulled down low, like he didn't want to be recognized. Or maybe he was just havin' a bad hair day, who knows? But I do remember he had a strong jawline, and his eyes... they were cold, detective. Real cold. Like he'd seen things, you know? Or maybe like he'd done things. He had a certain air about him, that's for sure.

Oh, and there was one more thing, detective. He had this scar, runnin' down his left cheek. It was faint, but it was there. Shaped like a crescent moon, it was. I only noticed it because he turned his head when he was lightin' a cigarette, and the flame cast a shadow on it. It was almost... eerie, in a way. But that's all I can remember, I'm afraid.

Do you think this man might have had something to do with Johnny's... well, with whatever happened to him? I hope my description helps, detective. If there's anything else you need from me, please don't hesitate to ask. I want to help in any way I can.

And detective, if it's not too much to ask, could you maybe keep me in the loop about what's goin' on with Johnny? I know he wasn't perfect, but he was a friend to me, and I'd like to know what happened to him. I promise I won't go blabbin' about it to anyone. I just wanna know, for my own peace of mind. Thank you, detective. I really appreciate it.
