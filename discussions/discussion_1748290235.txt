inspector: Pulaski here. You alone?

Mind if I ask you a few questions?

Where were you last night between 8 and 10?

You know a man named John Doe?

When's the last time you saw him?

What was the nature of your relationship?

You know anyone who might want to harm him?

You own a gun, knives, any weapons?

You mind if I take a look around?
