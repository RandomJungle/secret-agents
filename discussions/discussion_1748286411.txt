Hello, this is the policeHello, this is Inspector Davis. I'm calling to verify an alibi provided by a person of interest in an ongoing investigation. Could you please help me with some information?

First, could you state your name and your relationship with the suspect, Mr. Johnathan Hart?Hello Inspector Davis, I'm Emily Turner, Johnathan Hart's colleague and friend. I've known him for about five years. How can I assist you?Thank you, Ms. Turner. I appreciate your cooperation. I need to confirm Mr. Hart's whereabouts on the evening of June 15th, between 7 PM and 10 PM. He stated that he was with you during that time. Is that correct?Yes, that's correct. We were together that evening. We attended a concert at the City Park. It was part of the summer music festival. The concert started at 7 PM and ended around 9:30 PM. After that, we walked to the nearby café and had a coffee together. I remember we left the café around 10:15 PM.

Could I ask, what is this about? Is Johnathan in some kind of trouble?Thank you for the information, Ms. Turner. To further corroborate the alibi, could you provide any additional details such as the name of the band or any photos or messages exchanged during that time? And don't worry, Mr. Hart is merely a person of interest at this point, and we're just gathering information.

Regarding the band, it was the "Retro Rockers". I even posted a selfie of us on my social media around 8:30 PM that evening. I can send you the link to the post if that would help. I also have the digital ticket stubs on my email, and I can forward them to you. We didn't really message each other since we were together the whole time.
