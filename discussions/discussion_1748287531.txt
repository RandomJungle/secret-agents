Hello, this is the policeWell, well, well. Isn't this a cozy little place you've got here? Mind if I take a seat? The name's Polaski, Ken Polaski. I'm an inspector down at the precinct. Yeah, yeah, I know, you're surprised to see me. Most folks are.

This city, it's a dame with two faces. All glitz and glamour on the outside, but inside, it's rotten to the core. I've been walkin' these streets for more years than I care to count, and I've seen it all. Or so I thought.

We've got a bit of a situation, see? Someone's gone and gotten themselves killed, and word on the street is that you might know a thing or two about it. Now, I ain't sayin' you did it, but if you've got any info that can help me find the lowlife who did, well, that'd be swell.

So, how 'bout you pour us a couple of fingers of whatever you've got hidin' in that cabinet over there, and we have ourselves a little chat? What do you say?
****************************************************************************************************
Alright, alright, don't get your knickers in a twist. I see you're not keen on the hospitality, so let's get down to business.

I'm here because someone's gone and shuffled off this mortal coil a bit sooner than they were supposed to. A real tragic end, if you ask me. But then again, this city ain't exactly known for its happy endings, is it?

Now, I ain't gonna beat around the bush. You were seen with the victim not too long before they took a dirt nap. Care to share what you two were chattin' about? Maybe you saw something, heard something, hell, maybe you even know who might've wanted our poor sap dead.

Listen, kid, I've been doin' this job for a long time. I've seen good people do bad things, and bad people get away with murder. But every now and then, someone comes along who thinks they can pull the wool over old Ken Polaski's eyes. So let me tell you somethin': it ain't gonna happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

So, how 'bout you make this easy on both of us and start talkin'. The truth shall set you free, or so they say. And who knows? Maybe, just maybe, we can put this nasty business to bed and you can go back to your... whatever it is you do here.

But mark my words, if you're lyin' to me, if you're holdin' out, I will find out. And then, well, let's just say things will get a whole lot less comfortable for you.

So, what's it gonna be, hmm? You gonna help an old inspector out, or are you gonna make this dance a whole lot more complicated than it needs to be? The choice is yours, kid. But choose wisely. This city might be full of crooks and liars, but every now and then, justice finds a way. And I intend to be its helping hand.
****************************************************************************************************
Alright, kid, I see you're still mum. Maybe you think you're doin' the noble thing, protectin' someone, or maybe you're just in too deep. But let me paint you a picture, real clear like.

This city, it's a dirty, rotten mess. Always has been, always will be. It's a playground for the corrupt, the greedy, the violent. And it chews up and spits out the rest of us, like we ain't nothin' but yesterday's news. I've seen it happen, time and time again. Good folks, bad folks, it don't matter. This city don't discriminate when it comes to causalities.

Now, I ain't sayin' we can change all that. But maybe, just maybe, we can set one thing right. Maybe we can find the sicko who did this, and make 'em pay. Maybe we can bring some semblance of justice to this godforsaken town.

Look, I get it. You're scared. You're thinkin', "Why should I stick my neck out? What's in it for me?" And I wish I could tell you that doin' the right thing always comes with a pat on the back and a shiny medal. But it don't. Sometimes, it just comes with a whole lotta trouble.

But here's the thing, kid. You do the right thing because it's the right thing. Because if we don't, if we all just look the other way, then this city wins. The rot, the corruption, the violence, it all wins. And I don't know about you, but I ain't ready to roll over and play dead just yet.

So, I'm askin' you, one more time. Help me out here. Give me somethin', anything. Let's find the lowlife who did this, and let's make 'em pay.

But if you're dead set on keepin' your trap shut, well, then I guess we're done here. I'll see myself out. Just remember, kid, when you're lyin' in bed at night, starein' up at the ceilin', wonderin' if you did the right thing, wonderin' if you could've made a difference... remember this moment. Remember the choice you made.

And hey, who knows? Maybe our paths will cross again. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe you won't. But mark my words, this city might be a filthy, broken mess, but it ain't beyond savin'. Not yet, anyways.

I'll be seein' you, kid. One way or another, I'll be seein' you.
****************************************************************************************************
Got a call, down at the station. Another stiff, another poor sap who drew the short straw. This city, it's a damn slaughterhouse. But who am I kiddin'? You know that already, don't you?

I've been diggin' around, askin' questions, rufflin' feathers. You know how it goes. And your name kept comin' up, like a bad penny. So here I am, knockin' on your door, hopin' you can shed a little light on this dark affair.

Now, I know what you're thinkin'. "Not another cop, not again." But I ain't like the others, kid. I ain't here to shake you down or put the screws to you. I just wanna talk. I just wanna find out who did this, and why.

See, this victim, they were just like you. Just another face in the crowd, tryin' to make it in this concrete jungle. They didn't deserve what they got. Nobody deserves that.

So, how 'bout it, hmm? You gonna let me in, pour me a cup of joe, and we can chat like civilized folks? Or are we gonna do this the hard way? The choice is yours, kid. But remember, every second we waste, the trail gets colder, and the killer gets further away.

Tick tock, kid. Tick tock.
****************************************************************************************************
Alright, alright, I see you're still playin' the silent type. That's fine, that's just fine. I've dealt with your kind before. Thinkin' if you just keep mum, I'll get bored and walk away. But let me tell you somethin', kid. I don't get bored, and I sure as hell don't walk away. Not when there's a case to solve and a killer to bring to justice.

You see, this city, it's a puzzle. A big, ugly, messed-up puzzle. And every time someone turns up dead, it's like another piece gets added to the pile. And it's my job, my curse, to put those pieces together. To make sense of the senseless.

Now, I know you think you're doin' the smart thing. Keepin' your cards close to your chest, not givin' anything away. But let me tell you somethin' else I've learned in my long, miserable career. Secrets have a way of comin' out. Always do. And when they do, it's usually not pretty.

So, how 'bout you save us both a whole lotta trouble and start talkin'? Tell me what you know, what you saw, what you heard. Hell, tell me what you think. Anything, kid. Just give me somethin' to work with.

You know, when I first started out, I thought I could make a difference. I thought I could clean up these streets, make 'em safe for the good folks who live here. But it didn't take long for me to realize, there ain't no savin' this city. It's too far gone. But that don't mean I can't try to make it a little bit better, one case at a time.

Listen, I ain't gonna lie to you. This job, it's taken a lot out of me. More than I care to admit. But I still believe in justice, kid. I still believe in standin' up for what's right, even when it's hard. Even when it hurts.

So, what's it gonna be? You gonna help me out, or are you gonna keep on playin' the tough, silent type? Remember, every second we waste, the killer's gettin' further and further away.

But maybe that's what you want, hmm? Maybe you're not just a witness, maybe you're somethin' more. Maybe you're in on it, maybe you'reâ€”

*Knock Knock*

Well, well, well. Looks like we've got company, kid. Wonder who that could be? Only one way to find out. Let's see who's knockin' at your door, shall we? Maybe they'll be a bit more chatty than you've been.
