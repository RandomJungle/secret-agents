Hello, this is the policeWell, well, well. Looks like I've found my way to your doorstep, haven't I? Ken Polaski, inspector for more years than I care to count. I've seen a lot of things in this city, kid. Things you wouldn't believe. But that's a story for another time.

Mind if I come in? It's a little chilly out here, and I could use a break from the rain. The city's gone to hell, you know. Crime on every corner, and it's my job to clean it up. But enough about me, I'm here on business. Murder, to be precise. Nasty stuff.

You know anything about that, pal? I figure we can have a little chat, just you and me. What do you say? Let's make this nice and easy, huh?
****************************************************************************************************
I see you've got a nice little place here. Quiet. Too quiet, if you ask me. But then again, who am I to judge? I've lived in this cesspool of a city for too long, seen too many things. The noise never stops, you know? Sirens, screams, the sound of glass breaking. It's enough to drive a man mad.

But you, you've got it real nice here. Away from all the commotion. Mind if I take a look around? Just routine, you understand. A man in my position can't be too careful. This city's full of surprises, and not the good kind.

You see, there's been a murder. A nasty one, at that. Body was found down by the docks, face down in the muck. Not a pretty sight. But then again, murder never is. And word on the street is, you might know something about it.

So, why don't you do us both a favor and start talking, hmm? Make this easy on yourself. The truth has a funny way of coming out, one way or another. And in this city, it's always the hard way.

You got any coffee, by the way? It's been a long night, and I could use a pick-me-up. Black, if you've got it. Now, let's get down to business, shall we?
****************************************************************************************************
I see you're lookin' a bit nervous there, kid. That's alright, it's a natural reaction when the likes of me come knockin' on your door. But let me tell ya, I've seen guys built like brick houses crumble like stale bread when they've got somethin' to hide.

You see, this city, it's a dame with a heart of ice. She'll chew you up and spit you out before you can blink. I've seen it happen too many times. Good folks turn bad, bad folks turn worse. It's a never-endin' cycle, and it's my job to keep the wheels from fallin' off.

Now, let's talk about your whereabouts last night, shall we? No use beatin' around the bush. I know you're involved in this mess somehow, I can feel it in my bones. And my bones, they never lie.

You see, the victim, he wasn't just some schmuck off the street. He had connections, high up. The kind of connections that make this case a hot potato. And me, I don't like hot potatoes. I like things nice and cool, easy to handle.

So, start talkin', kid. Where were you last night? Who were you with? And don't even think about lyin' to me. Like I said, the truth always comes out, one way or another. And in this city, it's always the hard way.

You got any sugar for this coffee? Might as well make it sweet, seein' as how the rest of this night is gonna be anything but. Now, spill the beans, kid. Let's get this show on the road.
****************************************************************************************************
Alright, kid, let me level with you. I've been doin' this job for more years than I care to remember. I've seen this city at its worst, and let me tell ya, it ain't pretty. The streets are crawlin' with lowlifes, and the stench of crime is thicker than the smog.

But you know what keeps me goin'? The hope that maybe, just maybe, I can make a difference. Put one more scumbag behind bars, give this city a fightin' chance. And today, that hope led me to your doorstep.

Now, I ain't sayin' you're guilty, kid. But I ain't sayin' you're innocent, either. All I know is, someone's lyin' face down in the morgue, and someone's gotta pay for that. And right now, all signs point to you.

So, let's cut the crap, alright? You say you were home all night, that nobody can vouch for you. That's mighty convenient, don't you think? But see, convenience don't cut it in my book. I need facts, kid. Cold, hard facts.

You know, back in the day, this city used to be somethin' else. Sure, it had its problems, but there was a sense of... I don't know, honor, maybe. But now? Now it's just a playground for the sick and the twisted. And I won't stand for it. Not on my watch.

So, let me ask you again, kid. Where were you last night? And think real hard before you answer. Because I promise you, I will find out the truth. And if you're lyin' to me, well, heaven help you, kid. Heaven help you.

Now, how about you pour me another cup of that joe? It's gonna be a long night, I can feel it. And I wanna be wide awake when the pieces start fallin' into place. Because they will, kid. They always do.
****************************************************************************************************
Alright, kid, I see you're sweatin' like a priest in a whorehouse. That tells me you're hidin' somethin', and I aim to find out what it is. You see, this city's a mess, a real goddamn mess. It's my job to clean it up, one shitty lie at a time.

I've been walkin' these streets for what feels like a hundred years. I've seen good men go bad, and bad men get what's comin' to 'em. The rain washes the blood into the gutters, but it never washes away the stain on this city's soul. It's a place where dreams come to die, and the only thing that thrives is the rotten underbelly of crime.

But enough about the city's problems. Let's talk about yours. You see, I got a dead body on my hands, and a whole lotta questions. And you, kid, you're lookin' like a walkin', talkin' question mark right about now.

You say you don't know nothin', that you were tucked in tight, dreamin' sweet dreams all night. But my gut, it's tellin' me different. My gut's been my partner for as long as I can remember, and it's never steered me wrong before.

So, let's try this again. You know anyone who'd want the victim dead? Anyone with a grudge, a score to settle? You see, kid, every murder's a puzzle, and it's my job to put the pieces together. And right now, you're lookin' like a piece that just don't fit.

You got any friends, kid? Anybody who can back up your story? 'Cause right now, you're swingin' in the wind, and I'm the only one who can cut you down. But you gotta give me somethin', you hear? You gotta give me the truth.

This city, it's a harsh mistress. She'll use you up and spit you out, leave you lyin' in the gutter like yesterday's trash. But I can help you, kid. I can pull you outta the muck, but you gotta meet me halfway.

Now, how about you pour me another cup of that mud you call coffee, and we can start from the beginnin'. Who you know, what you know, where you were. The whole shebang. And don't leave nothin' out, you hear? 'Cause I swear to God, kid, if you're lyin' to me, I'll make it my personal mission to see you rot in a cell.

You see, this job, it's all I got left. It's the only thing that keeps me goin', the only thing that makes sense in this godforsaken city. And I'll be damned if I let some punk kid pull the wool over my eyes.

So, let's get to it, kid. The night's still young, and I got a feelin' we're in for a long ride. Let's make it count.
