I would then proceed to contact the remaining witnesses, Michael Brown and Sarah Davis, to obtain their accounts of the game night and further corroborate John Doe's alibi. If their statements align with those of Alexandra Smith and Emily Johnson, the alibi will be further verified, allowing the investigation to focus on other aspects of the case.
